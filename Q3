In this scenario, the most suitable data structures for representing the Square and Rectangle objects are structures in C. We can define a structure for the Square object with an attribute for its area and another structure for the Rectangle object with attributes for its length and breadth.

Here is a C program that defines the structures for Square and Rectangle objects and demonstrates their usage:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a structure for Square
struct Square {
    int area;
};

// Define a structure for Rectangle
struct Rectangle {
    int length;
    int breadth;
};

int main() {
    // Create a Square object
    struct Square square;
    square.area = 16; // Assume the area of the square is 16

    // Create a Rectangle object
    struct Rectangle rectangle;
    rectangle.length = 8; // Assume the length of the rectangle is 8
    rectangle.breadth = 4; // Assume the breadth of the rectangle is 4

    // Display the attributes of the Square object
    printf("Square Area: %d\n", square.area);

    // Display the attributes of the Rectangle object
    printf("Rectangle Length: %d\n", rectangle.length);
    printf("Rectangle Breadth: %d\n", rectangle.breadth);

    return 0;
}
```

In this program:
- We define a structure `Square` with an attribute for the area of the square.
- We define a structure `Rectangle` with attributes for the length and breadth of the rectangle.
- In the `main` function, we create instances of the `Square` and `Rectangle` structures and assign values to their attributes.
- Finally, we demonstrate the usage by printing out the attributes of the Square and Rectangle objects.

This program provides a basic demonstration of defining structures for Square and Rectangle objects and accessing their attributes in a C program.

To create an ordered list containing only book IDs and implement a C program to search for a particular book ID, we can use an array to store the book IDs and perform a binary search to efficiently find the availability of a book. Here's a C program that demonstrates this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_BOOKS 10  // Maximum number of books in the library

// Function to perform binary search on the ordered book ID list
int binarySearch(int bookList[], int size, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = size - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        if (bookList[mid] == target) {
            return mid;  // Book found at index 'mid'
        } else if (bookList[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return -1;  // Book not found
}

int main() {
    int bookIdList[MAX_BOOKS] = {101, 205, 312, 415, 522, 633, 715, 821, 937, 1005}; // Assume an ordered list of book IDs
    int bookIdToSearch = 415;  // Book ID to search

    // Perform binary search to check the availability of the book ID
    int index = binarySearch(bookIdList, MAX_BOOKS, bookIdToSearch);

    // Check the result of the search
    if (index != -1) {
        printf("Book with ID %d is available at index %d in the list.\n", bookIdToSearch, index);
    } else {
        printf("Book with ID %d is not available in the list.\n", bookIdToSearch);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this program:
- We define an array `bookIdList` to store the ordered book IDs. Here, we assume that the book IDs are sorted in ascending order.
- The `binarySearch` function is used to perform the binary search algorithm on the ordered book ID list. This function returns the index of the book if found or -1 if the book is not available in the list.
- In the `main` function, we provide a book ID to search for and call the `binarySearch` function to check the availability of that book ID in the list. We then display the search result.

This program demonstrates how an ordered list of book IDs and binary search can be used to efficiently check the availability of a specific book in the library.

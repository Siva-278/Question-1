Sure! Here is a simple C program that calculates the total weight of five treasures collected by Mr. John in the game Subway Surfers:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int treasures[5] = {10, 20, 15, 25, 30};
    int totalWeight = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        totalWeight += treasures[i];
    }

    printf("Total weight of treasures collected: %d\n", totalWeight);

    return 0;
}
```

In this program:
- We define an array `treasures` of size 5 that stores the weights of the five treasures collected by Mr. John.
- We initialize the `totalWeight` variable to 0 to keep track of the total weight collected.
- We use a `for` loop to iterate through the `treasures` array and add the weight of each treasure to the `totalWeight`.
- Finally, we print out the total weight of treasures collected by Mr. John during the game.

You can compile and run this program in a C compiler to calculate the total weight of the treasures collected by Mr. John in Subway Surfers.

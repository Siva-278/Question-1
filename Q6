Sure! Here's a C program to perform matrix addition for the given matrices A and B:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Define the matrices A and B
    int A[2][2] = {{3, 4}, {2, 4}};
    int B[2][2] = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
    int result[2][2];  // Matrix to store the result of addition

    // Perform matrix addition
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
            result[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Display the result of matrix addition
    printf("Result of matrix addition:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
            printf("%d ", result[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this program:
- We define the matrices A and B as 2x2 arrays.
- We perform matrix addition by iterating through each element of the matrices and adding the corresponding elements to compute the result.
- The result of the addition is stored in the `result` matrix.
- Finally, we display the result of the matrix addition.

When you run this program, it will perform the addition of the matrices A and B and display the result as a new matrix.
